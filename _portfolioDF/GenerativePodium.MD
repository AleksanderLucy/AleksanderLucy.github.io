## How to use generative design

## Generative design explained; future outlook

As humanity moves forward, and particularly looks towards our future on this planet and off of it, two emerging technologies will become increasingly useful: large format 3D printing and generative design. As these technologies continue to get more flushed out, and see more and more industrial application they could even become a key part of our next steps in extra planetary exploration, particularly through planetary surface construction. But first, it would be due to explain what each of these technologies are.

Large format 3D printing is a natural extension of the 3D printing that we all know and love right now, scaling the capabilities of 3D printing for fabrication up, unlocking more potential. 3D printing in its smaller scale has already been able to open up so many opportunities for new development and creative expression that would not have been possible without it, so this effect will only compound as the physical size limitations slowly drop away and large format 3D printing becomes more and more viable. In particular, one distinct advantage of the emergence of large format 3D printing is the ability to directly print large scale products, as seen in this project with the print in place podium. Extrapolating this application of the technology further, direct printing on location will be particularly useful for the aforementioned planetary exploration, as traditional construction techniques may be difficult to impossible in such environments. Fully automated construction using large scale 3D printing could unlock the potential for planetary surface settlements efficiently and without as much danger to humans.

Generative design is a powerful application of computational power to refine a design in ways that can be difficult to achieve otherwise. It is an approach that uses algorithms and machine learning to optimize a given problem iteratively. A design creates constraints and bounds for the problem then the computer generates a large quantity of solutions to the defined problem. This allows far more designs to be created in a shorter period of time than if it were only a person making them. Within the generation algorithm the computer is able to slightly alter the design and iterate through variations, testing them to ensure they follow the problemâ€™s constraints. Designs that do not meet the criteria are then discarded and other aspects of the solution are tweaked. After generation, the designer can evaluate the products across a variety of criteria such as cost, aesthetics, manufacturability, etc. Extrapolating from this powerful ability to iterate through a problem set, generative design can be applied to the issue of future planetary surface construction by iterating through construction locations and techniques to optimize the settlements. Furthermore, generative design could be used to iterate through the materials that can be found on site in order to maximize the potential for construction using exclusively found material. Analysis that the computer can run through in either of these cases can be done far faster, with far more iterations than would be simply possible with just a person or team of people. The optimization potential of generative design could also be applied to refine placements of settlements as it studies geography and iterates through considerations, or it could be used to optimize the location of solar arrays and other renewable energy sources. The potential to use this technology to brute force through all of the considerations necessary simplifies some of the challenges that come with planetary surface construction. Furthermore as this technology is developed with this in minds, the use case is increased for construction on our own planetary surface, not just those of foreign celestial bodies; work in the development of this technology provides engineers with payoffs much like the space race was able to give so much back to the earth residing population.

The application of both of these technologies is maximized even further when they are used in conjunction and combined to create even better products. Some forms of generative design differ from the previously mentioned style in that they push for a single solution based on the initial bounds of the given problem through sequential regression. This optimizes the design through random removal are subsequent testing to determine if that removal was viable; this is the form of generative design often implemented in computer aided design. This is the style of generative design that was applied to make the podium, but taking that regressive style that pushes towards a fully optimized design will be extremely important on planetary surface construction where materials are scarce and technologies will need to use as little as possible while maintaining functionality. This project proved the capability of generative design to be applied within a specific set of bounds, in this case mainly functionality and strength bounds, to create something that works with minimum material input. Another advantage of combining these technologies is that 3D printing, which is often used to create prototypes and proofs of concept, can be used to flush out the creations of the generative design algorithm. Large format 3D printing can be better suited for prototype production of larger parts such as those that may be used in construction projects, on earth or otherwise. With the power of generative design to create lots of options when it iterates through its algorithm, large format 3D printing will allow the designers to evaluate those concepts faster than if they were to rely on traditional manufacturing. In our planetary surface construction example, traditional manufacturing may not even be possible given the toughness of certain environments, making large format 3D printing combined with automation particularly appealing.

Overall, generative design and large format 3D printing are both extremely promising technologies that are beginning to see themselves truly flushed out, much to the benefit of our space traveling future and our continued earth residence. This project sought to demonstrate some of that potential in a combined, visually tangible manner that could show people how these technologies are not just sci-fi or theoretical, but are already seeing use today, a role that will only be expanding going forward.
