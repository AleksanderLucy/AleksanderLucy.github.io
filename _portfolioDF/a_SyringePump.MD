## Purpose

* Syringe pumps are devices commonly used to administer fluids over a set period of time or at a set rate.
  * They can be used for any number of applications but are most often seen in medicinal practice to administer medicine.
* Motor driven syringe pumps operate on a fairly simple design, but many commerical products can be very expensive.
  * This project sought to create an inexpensive version with off the shelf parts and additive manufacturing.

## Design Features

* The syringe plunger moves via a Nema 17 stepper motor driving a 2mm pitch lead screw; The lead screw's rotation actuates the lead screw nut on it linearly, moving the 3D-printed plunger holder forwards and backwards. 
  * The addition of a linear rod and bearing maintains axial alignment of the compontents during these moves.
* Syringes of both a 20 mL capacity and 5 mL capacity can be used and interchanged without fasteners. 
* The electronics are housed in a specially designed box. This is a fully enclosed box to contain all of the electronics and keep them free of any possible liquid intrusion or shock from touching. 
  * However, it features a removable lid in order to keep access easy and side slits for ventilation.

## Operating Instructions

The interface system should be intuitive, and the controls were designed with this idea in mind. 
* To set the flow rate - in mL per min - adjust the variable called flow_rate to the desired flow rate in the first line of the Arduino code under the //Global variables section. 
* Next, set the variable is_twenty to true or false depending on whether the 20 ml syringe is being used. 
* The black button on the side of the box controls the state of the syringe pump. 
  * If the latching button is pressed, the pump pauses. If the button is unlocked the pump resumes. 
  * When running, the syringe will move at the set rate until it is out of liquid and stops. An LED on the side of the enclosure serves as a visual reference for the syringeâ€™s operational state: green - actively running, yellow - paused, red - out of liquid. 
* Manual adjustments, if necessary, can be made using the white button to rotate the screw clockwise or the blue button to rotate the screw counterclockwise. Note that the pump must be paused or off to activate these manual rotation buttons.

## Operation Code

The aforemantioned code that is the only part the user needs to modify:
```c++
// GLobal Vars

float flow_rate = 5; //mL/min
bool is_twenty = false;
```

## Operational Limits
As with any machine, there are operating limitations that must be accounted for when running and operating the syringe pump. Since the syringe pump is designed to fit two different size syringes, there are separate limitations associated with each syringe. According to the Accelstepper library, the stepper becomes unreliable after about 1000 steps per second, so it became the limit. This was then multiplied by 60 to account for the number of seconds in a minute and finally multiplied by the calculated flow to result in the theoretical max flow rate for the 20 mL syringe. 
* For the 20 mL syringe, the theoretical max flow rate is 10.593 mL per minute, and the smallest volume of fluid that can be dispensed is 1.7655*10-4  mL per step (see calculations below). 
* For the smaller 10 mL syringe, the theoretical max flow rate is 6.0954 mL per minute, and the smallest volume of fluid that can be dispensed is 1.0159*10-4 mL per step. 

These are the operational limits as dispensing any faster would be inaccurate and could deliver the incorrect flow rate. Additionally, since the syringe pump is micro-stepping, the overall max flow rate gets slower as each rotation of the motor now contains 3200 steps instead of 200.
