## Purpose

* Phone cases are an important part of our daily lives, protecting one of the most valuble objects we carry with us every day.
  * The design of this everyday device can have suprising intricacies to keep buttons usable, add design elements and most importantly, protect your phone.
* Using additive manufacturing, something like a phone case can be designed to fit your custom aesthetic and protect your phone with top of the line materials at the reduced cost of doing it yourself.

## Design Features

* The material chosen for this case was the first concern since it does the protecting.
  * TPU 95a is a filament that can set and hold its shape with the ridgidity neccessary to grip the phone while having the felxibility to be easy to pull on and off.
  * This quality allows the case to absorb shocks as well preventing damage on accidental drops.
* To add a touch of personal flavor my case has the shape of the state of Georgia in counter-relief.
* The case also features funtional aspects like cut outs for the speakers charger ports and integrated buttons to operate the volume rocker and power button.
