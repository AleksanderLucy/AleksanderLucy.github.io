## How to use generative design



![Image](/assets/img/zigzag_diagram.jpg)

As humanity moves forward, and particularly looks towards our future on this planet and off of it, two emerging technologies will become increasingly useful: large format 3D printing and generative design. As these technologies continue to get more flushed out, and see more and more industrial application they could even become a key part of our next steps in extra planetary exploration, particularly through planetary-surface construction. But first, it would be due to explain what each of these technologies are.

Large format 3D printing is a natural extension of the 3D printing that we all know and love right now, scaling the capabilities of 3D printing for fabrication up, unlocking more potential. 

Generative design is a powerful application of computational power to refine a design in ways that can be difficult to achieve otherwise. It is an approach that uses algorithms and machine learning to optimize a given problem iteratively. A design creates constraints and bounds for the problem then the computer generates a large quantity of solutions to the defined problem. This allows far more designs to be created in a shorter period of time than if it were only a person making them. Within the generation algorithm the computer is able to slightly alter the design and iterate through variations, testing them to ensure they follow the problemâ€™s constraints. Designs that do not meet the criteria are then discarded and other aspects of the solution are tweaked. After generation, the designer can evaluate the products across a variety of criteria such as cost, aesthetics, manufacturability, etc. Some forms of generative design differ in that they push for a single solution based on the initial bounds of the given problem through sequential regression. This optimizes the design through random removal are subsequent testing to determine if that removal was viable; this is the form of generative design often implemented in computer aided design.
