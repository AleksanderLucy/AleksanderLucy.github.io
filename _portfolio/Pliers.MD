# About

This project sought to implement several different principles used in additive manufacturing but primarily focused on the print-in-place philosophy and the use of multiple materials in a single print job. To explain the print-in-place philosophy is as simple as reading it out; 3D printing complicated designs with mutiple components or a need for actuation can often be a long, sometime arduous, process with multiple printers and stages necessary to create all of the components, but if something is designed to be print-in-place, all components can be completed in one print job. Utilizing print-in-place design decreases the number of resourced necessary to produce said design (primarily through less printers) and can shorten print times without needing to take components off of the print bed and be actively waiting for each component to finish.
