## About

This project sought to implement additive manufacturing techniques to create microfluidic devices which require very fine details. These devices will be made out of polydimethylsiloxane, a widely used silicon-based organic polymer, which cannot be printed itself, making casting necessary. In order to create a cast with these fine details, the resolution of the 3d printer needs to be very high. As such, choosing what type of 3d printing technique will be used to print the part is very important; for this project vat photopolymerization, VPP, a stereolithography, SLA, technique was chosen. This process uses lasers to cure resin.
