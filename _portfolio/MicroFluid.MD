## About

This project sought to implement additive manufacturing techniques to create microfluidic devices which require very fine details. These devices will be made out of polydimethylsiloxane, a widely used silicon-based organic polymer, which cannot be printed itself, making casting necessary. In order to create a mold with these fine details, the resolution of the 3d printer needs to be very high. As such, choosing what type of 3d printing technique will be used to print the part is very important; for this project vat photopolymerization, VPP, a stereolithography, SLA, technique was chosen. This process uses lasers to cure resin which is a mix of acrylates and epoxies, maximizing the laser’s ability to cure the resin while minimizing part shrinkage when the polymers crosslink. As important as the technique is the printer itself, and a Form 3 SLA primer from Form Labs was selected. This printer features a Light Processing Unit (LPU), which allows a single galvanometer to scan in two dimensions. With the LPU, the beam is always perpendicular to the film, thus there are no distortions at the edges of the bed. The LPU moves horizontally while the galvanometer directs and steers the laser vertically. The laser is redirected via a parabolic mirror ensuring that the laser is perpendicular to the film with a circular spot. The Form 3 printer with the Black v4 resin will allow for the following specifications:

* Laser Spot Size (i.e., Minimum Feature Size): 85 μm
* Minimum XY Resolution: 25 μm
* Minimum Z Resolution: 25 μm
* Build volume: (145 × 145 × 185) mm
