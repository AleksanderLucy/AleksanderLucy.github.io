## Purpose

* The purpose of this project was to design and prototype a thermoelectric-operated single-can beverage cooler. The device will hold a standard aluminum can and cool it down from room temperature.
* The design of this was meant to emphasise everyday use and a low cost of production.

## Design Features

* This design sought to incorporate easily available, off-the-shelf parts with a product that already exists to keep a drink cool: the coozie. As such, the structure of the device is focused on easily fitting with the coozie form factor and will match its size to be mounted directly underneath.
* It features a three-tiered stack where the top is directly glued to the bottom of the coozie, the middle provides support for the heat transfer system, and the bottom will house the battery to operate it.
